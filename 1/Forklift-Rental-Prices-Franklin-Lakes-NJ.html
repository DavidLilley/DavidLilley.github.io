<h2>Reach Fork Truck Franklin Lakes</h2>
<p>On an F-150, one needs about a 4" lift to put on 35" diameter tires which is really the minimum for off road use here. Drivers in the market for a lifted truck need to perform an exhaustive inspection of the vehicle just like they would with any other pre-owned automobile. Browse through the vast selection of machines that have recently been added to our inventory.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>Whether you're looking to buy a new forklift, rent compact construction equipment, or service an existing machine, everything we do is rooted in the highest quality. But a truck with 31" tires just will not go anywhere unless it is paved and suitable for cars. When driving around in a lifted Jeep Wrangler, you are in control of a highly capable truck.

<p>However, uneven loads and those that exceed the machine's capacity can cause problems. This will give the lifted truck shopper an idea of how much off-roading the truck has endured.
