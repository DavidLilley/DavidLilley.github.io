To counter this trend and the associated challenges for the driver and reach truck, Linde has developed features such as Dynamic Mast Control to compensate for mast oscillation, introduced numerous measures to optimize visibility, and incorporated load displays.</p>
<p>So that your handling capacity stays high under all circumstances, Linde Material Handling offers a large selection of particularly agile pallet trucks. This allows our electric reach trucks to transport loads weighing up to 2.5 tons quickly and safely to their destination. Renting your forklift can also mean significantly lower up-front costs and the ability to plan on consistent monthly expenditures.</p>

These types of forklifts are faster and much more powerful than electric forklifts, but are also much louder.
