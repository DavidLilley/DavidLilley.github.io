Our diesel-powered counterbalance forklift models are designed and built for dependable performance in any application and have the power to cope with the challenge of outdoor conditions and demanding duty cycles.</p>

While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
