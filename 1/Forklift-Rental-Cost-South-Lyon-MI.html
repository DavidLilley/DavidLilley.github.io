<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift.

We currently have over 100 Forklifts in our rental fleet as well as Skid-Steer Loaders and a Telehandler.
