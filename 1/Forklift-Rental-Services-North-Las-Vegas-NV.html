Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels.

<p>Buying a vehicle that has already been lifted will save the buyer the cost of the hardware, plus the labor charges of installing the lift kit. Linde offers many additional options for all pallet trucks. The AM 22 hand pallet truck is also available in low-noise form. Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>
<p>Second, you need to make sure you request a rental unit which has the specifications best suited to the loads you are trying to move.
