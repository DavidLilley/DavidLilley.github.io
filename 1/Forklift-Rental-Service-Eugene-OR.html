In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>This Course has been designed for potential and existing plant operators who have received no formal instruction and those requiring refresher training. Rental forklifts are maintained to Crown's high standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Buying vertical order pickers comes in handy when the main job is order picking at increased requirements for productivity.</p>

More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>
