Automatic parking brake, electronic speed control and braking system provide enhanced driver safety and also contribute to the BT Pro Lifter's long operating life and low lifetime cost. Heavier loads shift the center of gravity forward even further.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>

OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
