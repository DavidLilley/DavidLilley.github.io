<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items.

Rough-terrrain lifts are particularly prone to abuse if they were employed at a construction site.</p>

<p>Firstly, a different training course is required for each type of forklift you wish to operate. Rough terrain pallet jacks 5 are designed specifically for use on uneven ground. Order-pickers and drivers of powered high-lift trucks face a variety of hazards that require training on compliant standards and practices, truck operational procedures, working surfaces and conditions, as well as fall protection training.</p>
<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
