<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>Combining the flexibility and value of renting with the power and dependability of a Cat forklift is the perfect combination for success.

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>You can always combine the best of both worlds, however, by choosing a great off-road focused Chevy truck, and then getting it lifted for even better clearance and larger tires.
