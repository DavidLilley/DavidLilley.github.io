<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence.

Suspension Lifts: For Pearland drivers searching for maximum lift, either for appearance enhancement or to survive on rugged terrain, a suspension lift is ideal.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1, of at full rearward till permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, whichever is less stable, Where tilt restrictions for various elevations are employed, and the rearward tilt position is determined to be less stable, the truck should be tested at maximum elevation for each tilt restriction permitted by the truck mechanism.</p>
