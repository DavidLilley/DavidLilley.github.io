Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

<h3>All Forklift Types La Grange KY</h3>
<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>CENTER CONTROL: The operator control position is located near the center of the truck.

Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
