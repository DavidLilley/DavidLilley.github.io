<h3>3 Ton Forklift Price Pelham AL</h3>
<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification. Many models of rough terrain forklifts are also 4-wheel drive; also available in 2-wheel. Electric forklift batteries last 6 consecutive hours or throughout an 8-hour shift with 2-3 breaks.

<p>Canada and Mexico remain the two largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers.

Operator Comfort- The Crown RR 5700 includes a suspended floorboard that absorbs vibration, and trucks can be outfitted with a ThermoAssist package for improved operator comfort in refrigerated or freezer applications.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
