It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets.
