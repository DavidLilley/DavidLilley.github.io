Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity.
