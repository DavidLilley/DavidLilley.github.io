<h2>Electric Forklifts Vs Gas Forklifts Morton </h2>
<p>Licensing prerequisites are the same for both conventional and rough terrain forklifts. If at any time a powered industrial truck is found to be in need of repair, defective, or in any way unsafe, the matter shall be reported immediately to the designated authority, and the truck shall be taken out of service until it has been restored to safe operating condition.</p>

Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>
