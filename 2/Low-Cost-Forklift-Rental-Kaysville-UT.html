The machine known as an orderpicker is an electric lift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads.</p>

Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
