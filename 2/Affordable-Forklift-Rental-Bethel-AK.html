<p>The Southeast team has years of experience managing large forklift companies, owning and operating wholesale forklift companies and turning wrenches when we need to. Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees. Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>
<p>Many warehouses and similar operations only need specific equipment at certain times of the year. Our nationwide dealer network has a broad range of lift truck models available for immediate rental. Fewer Responsibilities: With the purchase of a service or maintenance plan, if anything does go wrong with the leased forklift, the dealer will take care of it.</p>

Hand Pallet Truck with Scale is an excellent economic solution for all weighing requirements in busy warehouse environments , which allows you to weigh cargo where you want and when you want. If any of the foregoing trucks is equipped with attachments, the rated capacity shall be expressed in pounds at a specified load center and for a specified load elevation.</p>
