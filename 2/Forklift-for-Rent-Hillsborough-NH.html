<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Travelling and manoeuvring with the machine safely over a range of terrains, including steep inclines and undulating surfaces. Capable of handling heavy loads on all terrain types, Access Hire Australia's range of rough terrain forklifts are highly versatile machines.

<p>We offer our customers access to both Factory New as well as Pre-Owned forklift trucks. At Granite Industrial Trucks we are ready to meet the needs of your company today.

A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up.
