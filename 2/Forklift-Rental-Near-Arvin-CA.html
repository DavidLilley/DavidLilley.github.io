<h2>Hand Pallet Jack Arvin</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle.

Robotic technology is estimated to be used across the Class III Forklift Trucks over the forecast period.
