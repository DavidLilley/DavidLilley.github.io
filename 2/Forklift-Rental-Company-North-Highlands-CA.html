<p>The most complex type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit, which allows your truck to be boosted higher than that of a body kit.

<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking.
