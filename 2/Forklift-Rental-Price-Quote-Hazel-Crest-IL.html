Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks. In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded.</p>

The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>Even among lift kits, there are smaller options that just level out the truck from the common nose down‚Äù factory settings and others that will make your truck tall enough to walk under. Browse Order Picker Truck Equipment. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets weighing 3,000 - 6,000lbs.</p>

Rough terrain forklifts do not require the operator to be licensed in the United States.
