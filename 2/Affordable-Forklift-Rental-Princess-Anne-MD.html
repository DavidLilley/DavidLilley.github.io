<p>31. 31 Training Program Content (continued)  The requirements of the OSHA standard on powered industrial trucks must also be included in the initial operator training program. Forklifts can unload pallets of bricks, construction materials and steel joists from the delivery truck and transport them to the job site. The frame, cab, boom, and body of a tele-scoping-boom rough terrain forklift are usually fabricated by the forklift manufacturer.</p>

Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>
