<h3>Industrial Lifting Equipment Blue Bell PA 19422</h3>
<p>This early machine was used around construction sites and could lift about 1,000 pounds (454 kg) to a height of 30 inches (76 cm).

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
