<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients.

Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>
