<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>
<h2>Hand Pallet Truck Abington </h2>

Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
