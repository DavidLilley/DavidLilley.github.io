<p>Telescopic Handler forklifts are ideal for agriculture and anything that requires high lifting. Hand Pallet Trucks are equipped with quality materials, offering its high strength and durability.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. I notice two things right off the bat; one, the truck looks just about at home up there on that lift kit as it does on its stock ride height; and two, it hasn't seemed to have aged.</p>
