With our years of industry experience, we are able to successfully cater to the variegated demands of our clients by offering them Standard Pallet Truck. As you drive into a left-hand corner, the right tire will increase in weight as the vehicles weight is transferred from the centerline.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA.

Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable.

Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>
