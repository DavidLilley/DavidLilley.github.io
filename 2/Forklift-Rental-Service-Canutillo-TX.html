<p>They generally have a more limited range of types of rental equipment. The Forklift Trucks Market in Asia Pacific is likely to witness the highest growth in the coming years. Once this itemized list of goods (for example, a grocery order for a local store) is collected - usually on a motorized pallet jack - the order picker gets the pallet(s) ready for loading onto a truck.</p>
