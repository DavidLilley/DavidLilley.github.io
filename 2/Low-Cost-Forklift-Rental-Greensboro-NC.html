These lifts allow you to add beefier off-road tires and heavier suspension components but do come at a higher cost.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope.

<p>Using the combination of a leveling kit, a body lift kit and gap guards, Performance Accessories makes sure you are lifted the safest and most effective way possible. The electric forklift is equipped with a high efficiency AC driving motor. We are providing a huge range of Battery Pallet Truck to our valuable customers all over the nation.
