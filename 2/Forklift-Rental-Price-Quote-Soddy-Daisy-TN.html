The Air Lift compressor will mount onto your vehicle's frame while you will run the air line tubing from the compressor to your air springs.</p>
<p>Our ranges of products like Standard Hand Hydraulic Pallet Truck are designed and developed using advanced technology and superior quality raw material. In the electric forklift, the battery acts partially as a counterweight which saves space. Designed to automatically lock the pallet for a secure grip, the Automatic Pallet Grip feature provides optimum control of the load.</p>

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
