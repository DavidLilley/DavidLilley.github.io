<p>The civic body has said construction activities of public projects, construction, resurfacing, repairs, pothole filling of roads and bridges, works of laying and repairs of water supply, sewer and stormwater drain lines, construction repairs and pre-monsoon desilting of stormwater drains networks, and construction of health infrastructure facilities will be allowed to operate subject to observance of Covid-19 safety guidelines.</p>

This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
