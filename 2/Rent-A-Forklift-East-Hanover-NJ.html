Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up.

They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>
