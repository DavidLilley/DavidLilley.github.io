<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>
<p>Also, aftermarket installations like a lift kit can void the warranty on a lot of vehicles - that's a lot of benefits to leave on the table. Establish a timeline of how long your rental will last. We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town. Pump trucks are primarily used as a pallet jack but do not use any electric power to lift any materials.</p>
